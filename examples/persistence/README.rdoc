= MagLev Persistence Examples

This directory contains demos and examples using MagLev's built-in object
persistence.

== KDTree (Using Google Maps API)

The kdtree directory contains a pure ruby implementation of a KD-Tree,
a data structure that allows fast nearest-neighbor look-ups in
a given dimension.  In this example, we use the Google Maps API
as a GUI to display the closest zip codes to a given location 
selected on the map (a two-dimensional problem, since we must 
find the nearest latitude-longitude pairs for a given position).

== MDB

The mdb[link:files/examples/persistence/mdb/README_rdoc.html] directory
contains experimental code to wrap MagLev as a NoSQL Server (MagLevDB, AKA
MDB), and make it available to other applications.  The sample app can be
run from MRI, and will connect to the MagLev VM running the MDB server code
using HTTP.

== GStore

The gstore[link:files/examples/persistence/gstore/README_rdoc.html]
directory is a demo of how you might implement the standard ruby PStore
library using MagLev persistence, rather than the filesystem and marshal.
It is a proof of concept only.

== Hat Trick

The hat_trick[link:files/examples/persistence/hat_trick/README_rdoc.html]
directory holds a recreation of the "Hat Trick" performed by Avi Bryant at
RailsConf 2008, which you can see at http://vimeo.com/1147409 The code has
changed since then, and this example shows the new approach.

== Indexing

The indexing[link:files/examples/persistence/indexing/README_rdoc.html]
directory contains an example of how to index an unordered collection.
